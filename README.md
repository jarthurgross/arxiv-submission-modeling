# arXiv submission modeling

This is a notebook that performs a very crude analysis of the arXiv submission data in an attempt
to predict the first month with 10,000 submissions.

Data is taken from http://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions but duplicated here to ease
reproducibility of the notebook.
